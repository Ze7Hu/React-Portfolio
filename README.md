# 20 React: React Portfolio

## Your task 

Being a web developer means being part of a community. You’ll need a place not only to share your projects while you're applying for jobs or working as a freelancer but also to share your work with other developers and collaborate on projects.
Create a portfolio using your new React skills, which will help set you apart from other developers whose portfolios don’t use the latest technologies.


## Description 

This is a personal portfolio page created using React and the various features that React for Web provides. It contains an About page, Portfolio page, Contact page, and Resume page. The Portfolio page contains a list of six applications that I worked on over the past few weeks. The Resume page contains a downloadable copy of my resume. In the footer are links to my Github, LinkedIn, and Instagram.
